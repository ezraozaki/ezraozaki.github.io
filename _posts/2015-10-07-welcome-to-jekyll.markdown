<p style="text-align: center;"><b>About When2Meet</b></p>

**When2meet** ([when2meet.com]()) is a web-based product that helps people visualize their schedule with others. By being able to select the time that works for themselves, every members of a group can see when to arrange a meeting with each other would fit everyone’s schedule the best. On **When2meet** format, members can choose to fill out their weekly schedule availability, or choose specific dates on the calendar and add their availability. **When2meet** is created by 8 DEGREES LLC, a company that specializes in application and software development. **When2meet** was released in 2012, and the interface has been mostly the same as the year it was released. <br>

What makes it a good candidate for a redesign is that as it is, the product solely fulfills its role and that’s it. The interface is lackluster as it is merely a barebones design made to just get the job done. A lot of improvements could be made which would give it a strong boost over its competitors.

**PHASE I: Competitive Analysis** <br>
To learn of which aspects When2meet we could improve, we picked four other product, two direct competitors (whenisgood + Doodle) and two indirect competitors (MeetingPlanner + Google Calendar). Doing this provides us some inspirations in our redesign of the app.

**PHASE II: User Research** <br>
**<u>Background</u>**: This stage we focus on researching the user base of When2meet, with the purpose of understanding their goals, values, lifestyles as well as the needs they have when it comes to scheduler products.<br>
**<u>Methods</u>**: To conduct research to learn about When2meet current users, we utilize two distinct research methods -interviews and survey.

Our Study Objectives focused on being able to understand the context in which people are typically in when they seek to use the When2Meet service. This included learning typical age ranges of the person, their current occupation, how often they needed a service to assist them in scheduling meetings or other appointments, their gender, and other characteristics about the user and how/why they approached this particular system. Gathering this kind of information will assist our team in redesigning When2Meet specifically for the user base. We can do this by creating personas based on the information we obtain and work from there. 

>**Interviews**: Each member was tasked with doing at least 2 interviews each being around 20-30 minute long and we did a total of 11 interviews. We recruited participants that we thought  would fall under the target population, therefore we recruited participants that were mainly college students (undergraduates and graduates) as well as people that frequently worked in group environments (software engineers, business majors, etc.)

>**Survey**: As a team we decided upon creating a survey which included 20 basic questions that revolved around gathering information about our target population and the context in which they use When2Meet or even other scheduling services. After deciding on what questions we should ask, we each sent out at least 5 invitations for people to take our survey. The recipients of these invitations were those we had the emails in order to ensure that it at least reached 25 people.
