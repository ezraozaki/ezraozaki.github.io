**MOTIVATION**<br>
 
In today's current climate, time spent using screen based systems (smart phones, tv, game systems, etc.) has been increasing in the younger generations. The system we are creating helps to decrease the amount of time spent using screens and increase the amount of time spent playing in the real world. In cooperation with the RealPlay company, this system will be a multiplatform, interactive, and social media resembling system that will help connect parents to parents and children to children in order to create friend groups and plan events or hangout times for their children (depending on age).<br>

**TARGET AUDIENCES**
- Parents
- Children (5-14) (including various categories of children, disabled, home schooled, etc.)
- Nanny/babysitter/temporary guardian<br>

**OTHER STAKEHOLDERS**<br>
- Project managers
- Developers
- Testers
- RealPlay company
- Government entities/laws<br>

**GOALS**<br>
- To enable children to be able to meet up
- To enable parents to coordinate meetups (communicate)
- To ensure the safety of users and prevent fraudulent users<br> 

**ASSUMPTIONS**<br>
- Kids have access to cellphones
- Households have internet access
- Parents are involved in being responsible for safety, transportation, and communication for younger children
- Control flow cross platforms will have the same logical flow
- Parents communicate with caretakers outside of the application OR parents allow and trust caretakers to use their account.<br>
