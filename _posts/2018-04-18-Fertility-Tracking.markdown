This is the project I conducted under the mentorship of Professor Yunan Chen and Ph.D. candidate Mayara Costa Figueiredo (UC Irvine)
during the SURF-IoT fellowship, Summer 2019.<br><br> 

Fertility mobile applications are getting more and more popular with a vast number of them released to the market, which makes it difficult for the users to navigate around and find the one that is best for them. Many of these mobile applications make no difference among the reasons for tracking the fertility cycle (e.g., conceiving, avoiding conception, understanding the cycle), which raises questions if they are adequately supporting this specific population. This highlights the need to understand how this population uses such tools and how these tools impact their experiences.<br><br>

These apps, if being used properly, can help women understand their bodies and even detect their health problems early. Also, many apps support data synchronization with IoT devices like Fitbit, Ava, Wink...which makes the tracking process easier and faster. The purpose of our project is to explore the possible designs of the fertility app to elevate the users’ experience and offer them the ability to customize the app features in a way that meets their needs.<br><br>
