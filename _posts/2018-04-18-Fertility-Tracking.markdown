This is the project I conducted under the mentorship of Professor Yunan Chen and Ph.D. candidate Mayara Costa Figueiredo (UC Irvine)
during the SURF-IoT fellowship, Summer 2019.<br>

**INTRO and MOTIVATION**<br>

Fertility mobile applications are getting more and more popular with a vast number of them released to the market, which makes it difficult for the users to navigate around and find the one that is best for them. Many of these mobile applications make no difference among the reasons for tracking the fertility cycle (e.g., conceiving, avoiding conception, understanding the cycle), which raises questions if they are adequately supporting this specific population. This highlights the need to understand how this population uses such tools and how these tools impact their experiences.<br><br>

These apps, if being used properly, can help women understand their bodies and even detect their health problems early. Also, many apps support data synchronization with IoT devices like Fitbit, Ava, Wink...which makes the tracking process easier and faster. The purpose of our project is to explore the possible designs of the fertility app to elevate the users’ experience and offer them the ability to customize the app features in a way that meets their needs.<br><br>

**METHOD**<br>

To do this, we first chose the most popular apps on both Android and iOS platform (31 total) and conducted app evaluation to compare the goals that they claim to support and the tracking indicators they offer. We also downloaded and analyzed all the reviews of these apps then sorted them by goals, issues, positive aspects and keywords. This way, we can gain insight into what the users’ pain points are and in which way these apps could be improved.<br>

**RESULT**<br>

Based on the app store pages, period tracking is the most commonly offered goals (29/31), then Try to conceive (21/31) and Avoid conception which is 9. And only 7 apps offer the option to track pregnancy.<br>
**Note**:  Only 14 of them ask the user goal at the beginning, even though they claim to support multiple goals. Below are some examples of apps that do ask for the user's goal: <br>

Most of the time these apps uses a default interface for every cases; they lack the option to tailor the interface based on the users’ goals. Some reviews we got from the app stores related to the interface issue and the lack of pregnancy tracking:
>"If I’m trying to prevent getting pregnant it won’t show me when I’m ovulating even if I put that I am not taking any birth control. So I have to choose the option for trying to conceive to be able to see my fertility window and avoid pregnancy"<br>
>"I wish it had an option for if you’re pregnant so that the app don't keep telling you are period is late but over all great app"<br><br>

Another thing we found after analyzing the reviews is that most women come to these apps with a holistic approach, which means they use them for multiple goals in different stages of their life
