**INTRODUCTION**<br>
 
The project is to review the open-source e-book platform Runestone Interactive and make suggestions for improving the usability. For this project, we are focusing on the Win21-SI206 (an undergraduate level Python course at the University of Michigan) class materials, including Parsons problems, the assignment creation interface, and collaboration tools. We plan to produce suggestions for interface changes by interviewing users, conducting surveys, observing user engagements, and examining log file data to propose improvements through user studies. The e-book is one of the course materials that the client, Runestone Interactive Creator, uses for the Win21-SI206 class. In this class, students can learn Python by using the e-book’s interactive tools such as Parsons problems (drag-and-drop code blocks) and assignment features during the class and after the class. We will be focusing on four areas: the mix-up code problem, write-up code problem, Assignments page, and features that can help students collaborate in the class setting.<br>

**METHODS**<br> 
 1. User interview
 2. Survey
 3. Usability Test
 
 **I. INTERVIEW** <br>
We interviewed 4 students currently taking Data-Oriented Programming (SI 206).
Although their demographics were very similar, students had different reasons for
taking SI 206. For some students, the course was being taken to cover a future
requirement after they switched majors. For others, it was an elective taken to help land
a consulting job after graduation. Regardless of the reason, all students had some
programming experience prior to SI 206.

To analyze the interview data, we decided to use Affinity diagrams utilizing Miro. Miro is the online platform where you collaborate virtually through sticky notes. In each debriefing session, we gathered around 25-35 notes and put every affinity note on
individual sticky notes. After all the interviews were done, we started our interpretation
session. This is where we started our affinity diagram wall, in which we went over all
the sticky notes as a group and tried to cluster them into different categories.
As a team, we grouped similar ideas in the same group and each group we came up
with summary sentences. We iterated this process a couple of times and concluded five
high-level thoughts. In this exercise, we discovered four key findings on the high-level
category and the fifth one being student demographics. Based on the findings, we
started our brainstorming session where we listed out the frustrations we discovered
and came up with a list of recommendations to solve these problems.
<br>

| Finding | Recommendation |
|:-------:|:--------------:|
| 1. One of our findings is regarding mixed-up code and write-code problems. Mixed-up code problems are valuable for students' initial learning, but it can be difficult when working in a group because each student has a different order. Participant 3 stated, “I like [Mixed-up code problems]… I feel like just doing them a bunch of times helps me understand the structure of like, a class, for example.” Others have also reported information that backs up this statement. Participant 1 conveyed that mixed-up code problems help with learning and understanding indentation. A challenge with mixed-up code problems arises when working in groups. One interviewee informed us that the questions are the same, however, the code blocks on the left side are usually in a different order.| - Explanations for why code is wrong. This will help students develop a deeper understanding of Python. <br>- For group assignments, code blocks should be consistent. This will make the group work experience better because everyone’s code will match up. |
|For write-up code questions, students find them to be most helpful but desire feedback when they input the wrong code. Some students like to write the code themselves because they find it helpful for their learning. Participant 2 likes the load history feature of the write-up code question because it provides easy access to previous code that was written. There was one main thing that students want to be improved with write-code problems: receiving feedback. Students have said “Fill-in-the-blank problems do not tell you what the correct answer is” and “There is no feedback received for writing your own code.”|- Add a “Help Me” button to write-code problems that can check the code line by line and inform the student what is right and what is wrong and why.<br>- An alternative is showing other possible codes that can work as well. This will let students know that there can be multiple ways to code something.|

 **II. SURVEY**
Given our previous findings from four participant interviews, our final client recommendation required further understanding of the larger SI 206 student experience with the e-book. Based on this earlier study, the following four areas required further investigation:
- How do our users differ from one another?
- What is the users’ current product experience?
- Do students find the platform feedback in problem sets to be helpful, specifically with the ‘Check’ and ‘Help Me’ buttons?
- How do students feel about the assignments section of the e-book?

To reach a larger audience while also trying to understand their attitudes and experiences with the interactive e-book, a targeted survey was conducted. The survey was distributed to 144 students in the Winter 2021 semester class of students taking SI 206 with Professor Ericson.
