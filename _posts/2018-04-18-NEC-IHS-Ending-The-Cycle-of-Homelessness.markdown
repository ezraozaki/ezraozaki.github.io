**I: PROBLEM STATEMENT** <br>
The Institute for Human Services (IHS) is presently dedicated to aiding homeless individuals in Hawaii in securing housing, obtaining medical support, healthcare, and more, all with the aim of reducing the homelessness rate. However, the current method of manually managing and storing homeless information remains time-consuming and results in duplicated profile records.
<br><br>

**II: BUSINESS GOALS** <br>
The objective of this initiative is to streamline the management of clients for both field workers and administrators through automation, thereby saving time and enhancing the assistance provided to homeless individuals. The ultimate aim is to expedite the resolution of homelessness cases.

<br>
**TERMS USED** <br>
**Encounter**: Each time an IHS field worker meets a homeless person counts as one encounter<br>
**Client**: Each homeless person is called a client<br>
**User**: IHS Staff<br>
**Flag(s)**: A variable in the system that signifies the type of assistance a client needs (ex. Employment assistance, transportation, assistance with SNAP...)


>**Success Metrics**:
>- The number of encounters captured per month
>- The number of clients serviced per month\
>- The number of field workers engaging with the app
>- The time spent generating each encounter cut down

<br><br>
**III: USABILITY TESTING** <br>
>**Usability Tasks**: We conducted six usability tasks with each session lasting around 20 - 25 minutes on average. We recorded the participants while they were performing our usability tasks. For this, we thought up of five tasks that our participants would carry out. These five participants were recruited by each individual team member, each team member carried out a complete usability test.<br>

>**Cognitive Walkthrough**: By doing this, we figured out different usability issues which may make it difficult for the user to use When2Meet.<br>
