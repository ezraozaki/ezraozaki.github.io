**I: PROBLEM STATEMENT** <br>
The Institute for Human Services (IHS) is presently dedicated to aiding homeless individuals in Hawaii in securing housing, obtaining medical support, healthcare, and more, all with the aim of reducing the homelessness rate. However, the current method of manually managing and storing homeless information remains time-consuming, resulting in duplicate profile records.
<br><br>

**II: BUSINESS GOALS** <br>
The objective of this initiative is to streamline the management of clients for both field workers and administrators through automation, thereby saving time and enhancing the assistance provided to homeless individuals. The ultimate aim is to expedite the resolution of homelessness cases.

<br>
**TERMS USED** <br>
**Encounter**: Each time an IHS field worker meets a homeless person counts as one encounter<br>
**Client**: Each homeless person is called a client<br>
**User**: IHS Staff<br>
**Flag(s)**: A variable in the system that signifies the type of assistance a client needs (ex. Employment assistance, transportation, assistance with SNAP...)


>**Success Metrics**:
>- The number of encounters captured per month
>- The number of clients serviced per month
>- The number of field workers engaging with the app
>- The time spent generating each encounter cut down

<br><br>
**III: KEY TECHNOLOGY** <br>
[NEC Face Recognition](https://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/biometrics/face/index.html) is used in each encounter between IHS field workers and clients. As mentioned above, manually managing clients' info is time-consuming and often not accurate, which leads to duplicated client profiles in the database. NEC serves as the core technology that helps to alleviate this problem. <br>



**Main Feature**<br>
1. Add Encounter<br>
